# Rules and Guidelines for Next Time

## 1. Project Kickoff
- **Provide a High-Level Overview:** Start with a summary of project goals, constraints, and desired outcomes (e.g., overall-context.md).
- **Define Success Criteria:** List what "done" looks like for the project and each sub-app.
- **Share Folder Structure:** Document the intended code and documentation organization.

## 2. Documentation & Context
- **Maintain a Project Journal:** Track progress, decisions, and blockers in a running log (e.g., project-journal.md).
- **Use Checklists:** For each app, maintain a checklist for features, bugs, polish, and stretch goals (e.g., wrapup-checklist.md).
- **Document Edge Cases:** Note tricky scenarios, accessibility needs, and mobile quirks as they arise.

## 3. Communication with the Assistant
- **Be Explicit About Priorities:** If time or energy is limited, clarify what matters most (e.g., polish, new features, bugfixes).
- **Request Reviews and Summaries:** Ask for periodic reviews to catch inconsistencies and spot opportunities.
- **Share User Stories:** Describe real-world use cases and edge cases to help the assistant anticipate needs.
- **Ask for Suggestions:** Encourage the assistant to propose improvements, refactors, or new features.

## 4. Coding & Architecture
- **Favor Modularity:** Build shared components and utilities early; refactor as patterns emerge.
- **Enforce Theming:** Use a global theme system for all UI elements; avoid hardcoded colors.
- **Namespace LocalStorage:** Use unique keys for each app to prevent collisions.
- **Accessibility First:** Make overlays, modals, and controls accessible by default (ARIA, focus trap, keyboard navigation).
- **Mobile-First Design:** Prioritize responsive layouts and touch controls from the start.

## 5. Testing & QA
- **Automate Where Possible:** Add unit and integration tests for game logic and UI flows.
- **Manual Playtesting:** Regularly test on both desktop and mobile, and with screen readers if possible.
- **Bug Tracking:** Log bugs and edge cases as they are found, and revisit them before wrap-up.

## 6. Wrap-Up & Handover
- **Write App READMEs:** Each mini-app should have a README with rules, controls, and credits.
- **Document Stretch Features:** Keep a running list of future ideas and enhancements.
- **Solicit Feedback:** Ask users (and the assistant) for feedback on usability and fun.
- **Prepare for Open Source:** If relevant, add CONTRIBUTING.md and polish documentation.

## 7. Collaboration Etiquette
- **Be Patient and Clear:** The assistant works best with clear, specific instructions and context.
- **Iterate Frequently:** Small, frequent check-ins and edits are more effective than large, infrequent ones.
- **Celebrate Progress:** Acknowledge milestones and completed features to keep morale high!
