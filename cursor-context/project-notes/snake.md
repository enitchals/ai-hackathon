# Snake Game Requirements & Status

> **Status:** Core game mechanics implemented. Mobile support and theme integration complete. Polish and additional features in progress.

## Overview
A classic Snake game implementation with a modern twist. Players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while trying to avoid hitting the walls or its own tail. The game features responsive controls, score tracking, and a clean, themed interface that matches our project's design system.

## Core Features
- [x] Snake movement mechanics:
  - [x] Smooth, grid-based movement
  - [x] Direction changes (up, down, left, right)
  - [x] Collision detection with walls and self
- [x] Game mechanics:
  - [x] Food generation at random positions
  - [x] Snake growth when eating food
  - [x] Score tracking
  - [x] Game over conditions
- [x] Controls:
  - [x] Touch controls for mobile (D-pad layout)
  - [x] Keyboard controls for desktop
  - [x] Responsive to screen size
- [x] UI/UX:
  - [x] Game board with grid
  - [x] Score display
  - [x] Game over screen with restart option
  - [x] Shared header with back button and theme picker
- [x] State management:
  - [x] Game state persistence (high scores)
  - [x] Pause/resume functionality
- [x] Theme Integration:
  - [x] Full theme support for all game elements
  - [x] Dynamic colors for snake and food
  - [x] Proper contrast and visual hierarchy
  - [x] Consistent with project-wide theme system

## Polish & UX (In Progress)
- [x] Mobile-first, responsive design
- [x] Smooth animations for snake movement
- [x] Visual feedback for eating food
- [x] Theme-aware styling
- [ ] Sound effects for:
  - [ ] Eating food
  - [ ] Game over
  - [ ] Direction changes
- [ ] Accessibility features:
  - [x] Keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Screen reader support
  - [x] Color contrast compliance

## Future Enhancements (Not Started)
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels:
  - [ ] Speed variations
  - [ ] Grid size options
  - [ ] Obstacle placement
- [ ] Power-ups:
  - [ ] Speed boost
  - [ ] Temporary invincibility
  - [ ] Score multipliers
- [ ] Game modes:
  - [ ] Time attack
  - [ ] Survival mode
  - [ ] Two-player mode
- [ ] Visual themes:
  - [ ] Classic green snake
  - [ ] Custom snake skins
  - [ ] Animated food items
- [ ] Statistics tracking:
  - [ ] High scores
  - [ ] Play time
  - [ ] Food eaten
  - [ ] Longest snake

## Technical Considerations
- [x] Use React + TypeScript
- [x] Implement game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Use CSS Grid for the game board
- [x] Implement touch controls using touch events
- [x] Use localStorage for high score persistence
- [x] Follow the project's global theme system
- [x] Use shared AppHeader component
- [x] Proper TypeScript type safety

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Complete accessibility features
- [ ] Add difficulty levels
- [ ] Implement power-ups
- [ ] Add statistics tracking
- [ ] Add visual polish and animations
