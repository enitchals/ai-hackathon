# Tetris Clone – Project Outline & Implementation Status

## Overview
A modern, responsive web-based Tetris clone built in React + TypeScript, using a pastel rainbow color palette and modular, extensible architecture. The game is playable on desktop and mobile, with both keyboard and on-screen controls, and a unified look via the shared theme system.

---

## Features Implemented
- **Canvas Rendering:**
  - Playfield, active tetromino, and locked blocks are rendered on a canvas for smooth performance.
  - Ghost piece (preview of where the tetromino will land) is rendered as a semi-transparent overlay below the active piece.
- **Pastel Rainbow Tetromino Theme:**
  - Each tetromino uses a distinct pastel color, managed separately from the global app theme for flexibility.
- **Game Logic:**
  - Standard 10x20 playfield, 7 tetrominoes, bag randomization, gravity, collision, locking, and line clearing.
  - Classic Tetris scoring, level, and speed progression.
  - Hold piece logic (keyboard H or on-screen button), with one hold per drop.
  - Next piece queue (shows next 3 pieces in side panel).
- **Controls:**
  - Full keyboard support: arrows (move/soft drop), space (hard drop), X/Up (rotate), H (hold), P/Esc (pause).
  - On-screen controls for mobile: left, right, rotate, soft drop, hard drop, hold, pause.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Side panel with hold, next, score, level, and lines.
  - Pause overlay/modal (keyboard or button).
  - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
  - In-game instructions for controls.
- **Modularity:**
  - All logic and rendering are modular and type-safe, with clear separation of concerns.

## File Structure
- `src/tetris/TetrisGame.tsx` – Main game component, canvas rendering, state, controls, overlays
- `src/tetris/tetrisTheme.ts` – Pastel color palette for tetrominoes
- `src/tetris/tetrominoShapes.ts` – Tetromino shape/rotation data
- `src/tetris/types.ts` – TypeScript types for game state, tetrominoes, playfield
- `src/tetris/index.tsx` – Entry point for the Tetris app

---

## Next Steps / Suggestions
- Add polish: sound, animations, accessibility, and more game modes
- Refactor for even more modularity if needed as features grow
- Consider extracting more shared UI components if reused in other games
