## ADHD+D App: High-Level Summary
ADHD+D is a playful, D&D-inspired to-do app designed to help users focus by making task selection fun. Users add tasks to a list and roll a virtual D20 die to randomly pick a task; rolling a 20 triggers a break timer. The app features a modern, mobile-friendly UI built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI, and uses localStorage for persistent state. Core features include drag-and-drop task reordering, a modal for task focus actions, and a break timer with sound. The app is organized as a standalone route within the main gallery, with a clean separation of to-do and done lists. Most polish and accessibility improvements are complete, with only stretch goals (like sound effects and custom dice) remaining.
