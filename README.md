# ai hackathon
this is the one part of this project that's written totally by humans, totally for humans (well, okay, i'm sure several bots will ingest it).

i started today planning to build one complex side project to demonstrate what cursor could do. as i started thinking through what i wanted to prove, i realized that throwing cursor at a number of smaller side projects and seeing what worked and what didn't, then rapidly iterating, was probably the best way to learn.

so i 'vibe coded' my way through eight side projects in one (_extremely long_) day. each of those projects might've taken me a day or two or way, way longer if i'd coded it by hand.

there were plenty of stumbling blocks, but -- at the risk of sounding like i'm drinking the koolaid -- this was a _magical_ experience. cursor breezed through so many things i'd expected to pose problems. it felt like flying.

## Artifacts

[visit the deployed application here!](https://enitchals.github.io/ai-hackathon/#/)

here are the artifacts from today's session:

- [the overall context](./cursor-context/overall-context.md) that cursor kept for itself throughout the project
- [a project journal](./cursor-context/project-journal.md) detailing each of the apps we built
- [cursor's own reflections](./cursor-context/ai-reflections.md) on the process
- [some rules of engagement](./cursor-context/rules-for-next-time.md) to help us move faster next time

here are project files (generated for cursor, by cursor) for each of the apps we built:

- [adhdnd](./cursor-context/project-notes/adhd-n-d.md)
- [brick breaker](./cursor-context/project-notes/brick-breaker.md)
- [pac-man](./cursor-context/project-notes/pac-man.md)
- [racing game](./cursor-context/project-notes/racing-game.md)
- [snake](./cursor-context/project-notes/snake.md)
- [busy bee](./cursor-context/project-notes/busy-bee.md)
- [tetris](./cursor-context/project-notes/tetris.md)
- [wordle](./cursor-context/project-notes/wordle.md)
